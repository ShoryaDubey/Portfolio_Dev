Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the
last "terraform apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # aws_security_group.instance_sg has been deleted
  - resource "aws_security_group" "instance_sg" {
      - id                     = "sg-0e663b4ca0021858d" -> null
        name                   = "instance-sg20250722083536875100000002"
        # (10 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }


Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the
relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include
actions to undo or respond to these changes.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
